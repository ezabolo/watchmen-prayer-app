You are a full-stack web developer helping me build a global Prayer Watchman web app to recruit, train, and activate intercessors around the world. I want you to generate a complete production-ready MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application with the following key features:

---

# 🌍 PURPOSE:
Build a platform where users (called Watchmen) can register, take prayer training (videos, documents, QCM), participate in global prayer projects, submit prayer requests, and partners can donate and access their contribution dashboards.

---

# 🔐 AUTHENTICATION
1. Use JWT-based login/registration system for Watchmen, Partners, and Admins.
2. Include Google login using OAuth.
3. Roles: `watchman`, `partner`, `admin`, `regional_leader`.

---

# 🏠 PAGES & ROUTES:

### 1. Home Page
- Show platform vision and mission.
- Highlight current prayer campaigns.
- Include CTA to become a Watchman or Partner.
- Donation button with PayPal and Stripe.

### 2. Watchman Page
- Explain what a Watchman is (add sample static content).
- Biblical references and testimonials.
- CTA to register/login as a Watchman.

### 3. Partner Space
- Show list of existing partners and their impact.
- Allow partner registration.
- After login, partners should access their dashboard:
  - View projects supported
  - Submit new prayer initiatives
  - View impact reports
  - Donation history

### 4. Prayer Request
- Public page with form to submit prayer requests (anonymous or not).
- Display of public prayer wall (optional moderation flag).

### 5. Prayer Space
- Calendar of upcoming prayer events (global and regional).
- Show types of prayer (intercessory, childbirth, 24h prayer, etc).
- Display real-time impact counters (hours prayed, countries reached).
- Filter events by region or prayer type.

### 6. Training Space (CORE FEATURE)
- List of available trainings.
- Training = [title, description, type: video/pdf/qcm, content]
- Require login before registering.
- Each watchman must have:
  - Progress tracker
  - Video player
  - PDF viewer
  - Multiple-choice quizzes (QCM)
- Auto-certificates after completion.
- Notify regional leader upon new registration.

### 7. Admin Panel
- Upload training (pdf, video, quiz).
- Assign regional leaders to regions.
- Manage users, events, donations.
- Generate reports.
- Approve prayer requests and projects.

# 📊 DATABASE MODELS (MongoDB)

- `User`: { name, email, password, role, region, registered_at }
- `Training`: { title, description, type, file_url, quiz }
- `Quiz`: { question, options[], correct_answer }
- `Progress`: { user_id, training_id, completed, score }
- `Partner`: { org_name, email, logo, donations }
- `Project`: { title, description, region, sponsored_by, start_date }
- `PrayerRequest`: { name, message, anonymous, category, submitted_at }
- `Event`: { title, date, location, category }
- `Donation`: { donor_email, amount, date, method }

# 🛠️ TECH STACK

Frontend:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls

Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- Multer for file uploads (PDFs, videos)
- JWT Auth

3rd Party:
- PayPal & Stripe for donations
- Google OAuth for login
- AWS S3 for training content hosting

---

# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT

- Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
- Backend: Render, Railway, or Heroku
- DB: MongoDB Atlas

---

# ✅ STEP 1 TASK:

Start by scaffolding the MERN app folder structure with:
- `/client` for React frontend
- `/server` for Express backend
- `/models` for MongoDB schemas
- `/routes` for API routes
- `/controllers` for logic
- Provide npm scripts for dev: `npm run dev`

Then build the **authentication system first**, including:
- Registration
- Login (JWT)
- Role-based access control

Once done, I will prompt you for the next module (Training or Partner space).
